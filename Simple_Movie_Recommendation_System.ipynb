    "## Decision Tree Classifier \n",
    "A Decision Tree is a simple representation for classifying examples. It is a Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the concept of Decision Tree consider the above example. Let’s say you want to predict whether a person is fit or unfit, given their information like age, eating habits, physical activity, etc. The decision nodes are the questions like ‘What’s the age?’, ‘Does he exercise?’, ‘Does he eat a lot of pizzas’? And the leaves represent outcomes like either ‘fit’, or ‘unfit’. There are two main types of Decision Trees: Classification Trees. Regression Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification trees (Yes/No types) : What we’ve seen above is an example of classification tree, where the outcome was a variable like ‘fit’ or ‘unfit’. Here the decision variable is Categorical/ discrete. Such a tree is built through a process known as binary recursive partitioning. This is an iterative process of splitting the data into partitions, and then splitting it up further on each of the branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression trees (Continuous data types) : Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. (e.g. the price of a house, or a patient’s length of stay in a hospital)"
