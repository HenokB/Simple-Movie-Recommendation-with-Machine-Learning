# Simple-Movie-Recommendation-with-Machine-Learning
##"Using Machine Learning for Creating a Movie Recommendation System"

### Goal
My goal in this project is to use machine learning to be able to build a movie recommendation system. I used a decision tree classifier to write the program.


### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x**and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the latest version of Python installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Simple_Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb` notebook file.


### Data

The Movie dataset to be used in this project is simply made for this purpose.

**Features**
1.  `Age`
2. `Genre`
3. `Gender`
